This Java-based project provides a comparative analysis of cryptographic algorithms (encryption and hashing), simulates attack strategies
(dictionary, brute-force, hash collisions), and presents results through a user-friendly GUI with charting capabilities.


## How to run

- **Java 21**
- Clone the repository and run **MainGUI.java**, the project comes with encrypted/decrypted docs so every single option works out,
-  if you want to try it on your data, modify the **resources/input.txt** file
-  To modify keys go to **gui/TestRunner** and modify the **key** values inside of **runCryptoTests()**
-  **Different algorithms use different key sizes.**
